# File Contents to Clipboard

This is a very simple script that copy's contents of a file to the clipboard for quick and easy copy/paste. It's most useful when the script is in a bin directory in the PATH variable and/or aliasing a shorthand command to the script.  This script takes a single command line argument, which is the file

### Example Use

```sh
$ ./file_contents_to_clipboard.sh README.md
```

Once run, paste the contents into any text editor, and you should see the text from this README.
